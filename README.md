**CancerDiscover** is an open source pipeline tool (released under the [GNU General Public License v3](LICENSE.md)) that allow users to efficiently and automatically process large high-throughput datasets by converting data (for example CEL files, etc.), normalizing, and selecting best performing features from multiple feature selection algorithms. The pipeline lets users apply different feature thresholds and various learning algorithms to generate multiple prediction models that distinguish different types and subtypes of cancer.

***WARNING***: CancerDiscover is an open-source software, in case if you run across bugs or errors, raise an issue over [here](https://github.com/akram-mohammed/CancerDiscover/issues).

### Purpose
The purpose of this free, open-source pipeline tool is to convert raw high-throughput data (for example `CEL` files etc.) into WEKA-native (`Attribute Relation File Format` [`arff`]) for cancer class and subtype classification and biomarker identification.

This README file will serve as a guide for using this software tool. We suggest reading through the entire document at least once, in order to get an idea of the options available, and how to customize the pipeline to fit your needs.

### Downloading CancerDiscover
Clone the git repository:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/akram-mohammed/CancerDiscover.git && cd CancerDiscover
```
### Dependencies 

Before installing **CancerDiscover**, make sure you have all the necessary software packages installed. 

#### Installing R

From the command line, enter the following commands below: 

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base
```
#### Installing Bioconductor and R packages

**Run R**
Once `R` is installed youâ€™ll need to run the commands from within `R`.
From the commandline enter the following command:

```
R
```

**Install Bioconductor**
Once R has finished loading, enter the following command:

```
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
```

If there is a updated bioconductor package is available, run the following command:

```
biocLite("BiocUpgrade")
```

**Install Affy R module**
Enter the following command to install the `Affy` `R` package:

```
biocLite("affy")
```

**Annotation Database Interface**
You will also need a package called `AnnotationDbi` which can be installed with the command below:

```
biocLite("AnnotationDbi")
```

It provides user interface and database connection code for annotation data packages using SQLite data storage.

**CDF (Chip Definition File)**

Command to download the plate *HG_U133_Plus2* `cdf`:
```
biocLite("hgu133plus2cdf")
```
It is important to note that not all data must have been derived from affymetrix plates which meet the requirements put in place by the `Affy` `R` package. Plates such as *HG_U95* and *HG_U133* are known to be acceptable as long as their associated `cdf` has been installed.

#### Installing WEKA

This project utilizes [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) 3-6-11. In order to get this version, in a directory outside of the `CancerDiscover` directory, execute  the following command:

```
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/files/weka-3-6/3.6.11/weka-3-6-11.zip/download
```

Next, set the `WEKA` classpath by entering the following command in `.bashrc` file under Alias definitions:

```
export WEKAINSTALL=/absolute/path/to/weka/directory/`
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$WEKAINSTALL/weka.jar
```
For example: 

```
export WEKAINSTALL=/home/general/weka/weka-3-6-11`
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$WEKAINSTALL/weka.jar
```

**Note:** Since WEKA is Java-based framework, the user needs to install and set the classpath for `JAVA`.

### System Requirements

You will need current or very recent generations of your operating system: 
**Linux OS**, **Mac OS X**.

### Directory Structure of the Pipeline

After installation of **CancerDiscover**, notice inside the **CancerDiscover** directory there are several empty directories and one which contains all of the scripts necessary to process data:

 - `DataFiles` will contain raw `CEL` files and `sampleList.txt` file;
 - `Outputs` directory contains  `resultsSummary.txt` file which will have the summary of  the model accuracies as well as information   regarding the context which gave the highest accuracy; 
- `Scripts` directory contains all of the source code; 
- `Models` directory contains all of the classification models;
- `Temp` directory contains intermediate files that are generated as part of the execution of the pipeline;
- `Feature Selection` directory contains the feature selection algorithm output files and two nested directories for `arff` file; generation, namely `Chunks` and `ArffPreprocessing`;
- `Chunks` contains different threshold feature sets;
- `ArffPreprocessing` directory contains the feature vectors in `arff` format . Feature vectors made here are split into training and testing datasets in their respective directories;
- `Train` is the repository of the training data for the modeling;
- `Test` is the repository of the testing data for model testing;
- `SampleData` is a directory which contains 10 sample `CEL` files and their associated `sampleList.txt` file;
- `Logs` is a directory which contains the elapsed time in seconds for each leg of the pipeline from initialization through model testing;
- `CompletedExperiments` When the pipeline has finished running, the above directories which contain experimental data will be moved into this directory. This directory will act as a repository of old experiment files organized by a time-stamp which reads as `Year-month-day-hours-minutes-seconds`.

### Execution of Pipeline

The first step is be to place your raw `CEL` file data into the `DataFiles` directory.

In the `DataFiles` directory you will need to create a two column `csv` (comma separated file) called *"sampleList.txt"* where the first column will have the name of each `CEL` file, and the second column will have the class identifier to be associated with that sample. See an example below:
```
CL2001031606AA.CEL,squamousCellCarcinoma
CL2001031607AA.CEL,squamousCellCarcinoma
CL2001031608AA.CEL,adenocarcinoma
CL2001031609AA.CEL,squamousCellCarcinoma
CL2001031611AA.CEL,adenocarcioma
```
If you want to use the Sample data for classification:
     
     ```
     cp SampleData/* ../DataFiles
     ```
     
    This command will copy all of the data and `sampleList.txt files` in the `SampleData` directory to the `DataFiles` directory.  
     
1. **Initialization** 

   Once you have finished making the `sampleList.txt` file in the `DataFiles` directory, please go inside  the `Scripts` directory to      execute the next steps of the pipeline.

   There are two versions of the pipeline, `BASH` and `SLURM` (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management). `SLURM` is a computational    architecture used to organize user requests into a queue to utilize super-computer resources. `SLURM` requires no kernel         modifications for its operation and is relatively self-contained. Depending on your access to a `SLURM` scheduler, you will use one or    another set of scripts. If you do have access to a `SLURM` scheduler you will execute the scripts ending in `.slurm`. Otherwise, you will use the scripts ending in `.bash` . Due to the complexity of data manipulation, and/or the sheer size of your data, it is recommended to use a high-performance computer. 

   Now, in the `Scripts` directory, edit the file called `Configuration.txt`, to make any changes desired for processing your data    including the normalization method, the size of data partitions, and which feature selection and classification algorithms are to be executed . The default settings for normalization and background correction and data partitioning are:
 
      - *Normalization:* `normMethod="quantiles"`
      - *Background correction:* `bgCorrectMethod="rma"`
      - *Pm value correction:* `pmCorrectMethod="pmonly"`
      - *Summary:* `summaryMethod="medianpolish"`
      - *Number of folds for data partitioning:* `foldNumber=2`
 
   The default setting for data partitioning is *50:50*. 
   
   The default setting for feature selection algorithms will choose all possible feature selection algorithm options. You can find the list of feature selection methods and their associated file names in `featureSelectionAlgorithms.lookup` under `Scripts` directory. 
   
   The default setting for classification algorithms will generate models using the following algorithms:
      - *Decision Tree*
      - *IBK*
      - *Naive Bayes*
      - *Random Forest*
      - *Support Vector Machine*
      
    If you wish to use classification algorithms other than the ones provided, please refer to the `WEKA` resources at http://weka.wikispaces.com/Primer. 
    
    In the configuration file you will also need to write in the absolute path. This path should end in `CancerDiscover`; for example a directory path might look like: `work/userGroup/userMember/data/CancerDiscover`
  
   ```
   cd ../Scripts
   bash initialization.bash
   ```

2. **Normalization**
    
    ```
    bash masterScript_1.bash
    ```

     For `SLURM` users:

    ```
    sbatch masterScript_1.slurm
    ```
   
     The  purpose of the above script is to perform normalization on raw `CEL` data and generate the *Expression set matrix*. For other options, refer to https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/affy/inst/doc/builtinMethods.pdf3
     
3. **Feature Selection**

   After normalization is complete, you will have a single file called `ExpressionSet.txt` in your `DataFiles` directory. The next step is to build a master feature vector file using the `ExpressionSet.txt` file. The next command you use will build this master feature vector file for you using the `ExpressionSet.txt` file, as well as perform data partitioning, or divide the master feature vector file into two parts; *training* and *testing*. The program will then perform feature selection using only the *training* portion of the master feature vector. Additionally, you can find the list of feature selection methods and their associated file names in the `Scripts` directory in the file named `featureSelectionAlgorithms.lookup`.

   The default setting for data partitioning is *50:50*, meaning the master feature vector file will be split evenly into **training** and *testing* data sets while retaining approximately even distributions of your sample classes between the two daughter files. To achieve a larger split, such as *80:20* for training/testing, in the configuration file `Configuration.txt` replace the `2` with a `5`. This will tell the program to perform 5 folds, where the *training* file will retain `4` and the *testing* file will retain a single fold or *20%* of the master feature vector data. 

   The default setting for feature selection will perform all possible forms of feature selection available unless otherwise specified in the `configuration.txt` file. If you wish to change these feature selection options, in the `Scripts` directory you will need to edit the file named `configuration.txt`. Simply write `TRUE` next to all of the feature selection methods you wish to perform and `FALSE` if you do not want that method performed. Additionally, you can find the list of feature selection methods and their associated file names in the `Scripts` directory in the file named `featureSelectionAlgorithms.lookup`.
  
   The following commands perform the feature selection from normalized expression matrix:

      ```
      bash masterScript_2.bash
      ```
 
      For `SLURM` users:   
  
     ```
     sbatch masterScript_2.slurm
     ```
  
4.  **Model training and testing**

       Once feature selection has been completed, new feature vectors are made based on the ranked lists of features.  The new feature vectors will be generated based on your threshold selections, and immediately  used to build and test classification models using a classification algorithm of your choosing. Lastly, the directories will be reset, and your old directories and files will be placed in the `CompletedExperiments` followed by a time-stamp. 
       
       The following commands perform model training and testing on the feature vectors:
   
      ```
      bash masterScript_3.bash
      ```

      For `SLURM` users:
 
      ```
      sbatch masterScript_3.slurm
      ```
      
       The last lines of the `masterScript_3` scripts will move the content of the `DataFiles` to `CompletedExperiments`, so the new  experiment will run in `DataFiles` directory. You can find all raw data, feature selection outputs, training and testing feature vectors, models, and model results in the `CompletedExperiments` directory followed by a time-stamp. To run experiments with new data, begin with [step 1](#execution-of-pipeline).
      
      Overall, the users will require to run only 4 scripts.
      ```
      bash initialization.bash 	# Initialization
      bash masterScript_1.bash 	# Normalization
      bash masterScript_2.bash	# Feature Selection
      bash masterScript_3.bash	# Model Training and Testing
      ```
